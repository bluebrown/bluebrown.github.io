# Hardware Primer

Before we can think about the software we are going to write, we need to
understand the hardware we are going to run it on. As and OS is not an ordinary
program, it needs to control the hardware for the user programs.

When opening up a computer, and perhaps by the name itself, one might be
inclined to the that the [motherboard] is the most important part of the
computer. This is not the case. The most important part of the computer is the
[CPU]. The motherboard is just a way to connect the CPU to the other parts of
the computer. That is also why we gernally name the CPU familiy as the
architecture.

The CPU is the part of the computer that executes the instructions. It is
connected to the [RAM] (Random Access Memory) which is used to store the
instructions and data that the CPU is going to use. The CPU is also connected
to the [I/O] (Input/Output) devices, such as the keyboard, mouse, screen,
harddrive, etc.

The CPU is connected to the RAM and I/O devices through the [bus]. The bus is a
set of wires that connect the CPU to the RAM and I/O devices. The bus is
divided into two parts: the [address bus] and the [data bus]. The address bus
is used to tell the RAM and I/O devices where to read or write data. The data
bus is used to transfer the data between the CPU and the RAM and I/O devices.

Firmware is a special kind of software that is stored in the [ROM] (Read-Only
Memory) of the computer. The firmware is used to boot the computer and load the
OS. The firmware is also used to control the hardware of the computer.
