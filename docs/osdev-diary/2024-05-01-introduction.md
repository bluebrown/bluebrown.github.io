# Introduction

Recently, after some silly banter with a friend of mine, we decided to *simply
write* an OS from scratch.

I know this is not easy, but I also believe that at our core, we are problem
solvers. Not developers, or sysadmins, or whatever title you might carry. We
are problem solvers. And this is *just* another problem to solve. *How hard
could it be?*

Leading with this *naive* mindset, we started to think about the project. I
heared some OS jargon before, but I never really understood what it meant or
gave it much thought. Well, we knew it was going to be some x86 architecture,
and that was about it.

Follow along as we dive into the unknown, and try to make sense of it all.
